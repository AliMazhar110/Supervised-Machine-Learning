    "Breast cancer is one of the most common cancers among women worldwide, making early and accurate diagnosis critically important for treatment and management. This Jupyter notebook explores the application of logistic regression, a powerful statistical and machine learning technique, for predicting whether breast cancer is benign or malignant based on various diagnostic measurements. Logistic regression is a predictive analysis algorithm used primarily for binary classification problems. It models the probabilities of default classes (benign or malignant in this case) based on input features using a logistic function (or sigmoid function). This function outputs values between 0 and 1, which are then mapped to two classes.\n",

    "### Dataset\n",
    "The dataset used in this analysis is the Breast Cancer Wisconsin (Original) dataset, which is commonly used in predictive modeling. It includes features such as the thickness of the clump, uniformity of cell size and shape, marginal adhesion, and other cellular attributes.\n",

    "### Sections of the Notebook\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Section 1: Logistic Regression with Scikit-learn\n",
    "This section will cover data preprocessing, model fitting, and evaluation using the high-level Scikit-learn library. We will explore how to effectively utilize this library to implement logistic regression in a few lines of code.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Section 2: Building Logistic Regression from Scratch\n",
    "Here, we delve deeper into the mechanics of logistic regression. We'll manually implement functions for hypothesis representation, cost calculation, gradient computation, and parameter updates. This exercise will provide a foundational understanding of the algorithm and its optimization via gradient descent."
